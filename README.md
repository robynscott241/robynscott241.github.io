## About Me
My name is Robyn and I am currently a GAP Gradate Intern at Dimension 
Data in Johannesburg. I have a Masters degree in business resilience 
and environmental risk. I live with my fianc√© and our three dogs, in 
a house we purchased for ourselves in 2017. I am passionate about
sustainability and environmental affairs and the role we can play
in protecting our environment. One of my unique features is my below
knee amputation and my prosthetic leg.
